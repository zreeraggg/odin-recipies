    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Creamy Chicken is a simple, comforting dish made with tender pieces of boneless chicken simmered in a rich, velvety sauce. Lightly seasoned with salt, black pepper, and garlic, and brought together with condensed cream of chicken soup, this recipe delivers cozy, homemade flavor with minimal effort. Perfect for busy days, it pairs wonderfully with rice, pasta, or warm bread for a satisfying meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ground Black pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the boneless chicken breasts dry. Season both sides evenly with salt, ground black pepper, and garlic powder. Don’t be shy—this is where the flavor starts.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium heat. Place the seasoned chicken in the pan and cook until lightly golden on both sides. You’re not fully cooking it yet, just building color and flavor.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat and add the condensed cream of chicken soup directly to the pan. Spread it around so the chicken is coated.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and let it simmer gently for about 12–15 minutes, turning the chicken once halfway through. The chicken cooks through while the sauce thickens and becomes silky.</li>
        <li>Taste the sauce and adjust salt or pepper if needed. If it’s too thick, add a small splash of water and stir.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and rest for a couple of minutes before serving. The sauce settles and clings beautifully to the chicken.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve it over rice, mashed potatoes, or plain bread. This dish is proof that culinary elegance sometimes wears pajamas and lives in a can.</p>
