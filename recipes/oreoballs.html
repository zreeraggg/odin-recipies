    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Oreo Balls are rich, bite-sized treats made by blending crushed Oreos with smooth cream cheese, then coating them in glossy melted baking chocolate. With a soft, fudgy center and a crisp chocolate shell, these no-bake delights are irresistibly indulgent and incredibly easy to make. Perfect for parties, gifting, or satisfying a quick chocolate craving without turning on the oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oreos</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Baking Chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the Oreos in a bowl and crush them into fine crumbs. You can use a food processor or a rolling pin and some patience.</li>
        <li>Add the cream cheese to the crushed Oreos. Mix until everything comes together into a smooth, thick dough with no dry crumbs.</li>
        <li>Scoop small portions of the mixture and roll them between your palms to form bite-sized balls.</li>
        <li>Place the balls on a plate or tray lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate for about 20–30 minutes so they firm up.</li>
        <li>Melt the baking chocolate using a double boiler or microwave in short intervals, stirring until smooth and glossy.</li>
        <li>Dip each chilled Oreo ball into the melted chocolate, coating it completely. Let excess chocolate drip off.</li>
        <li>Place the coated balls back on the lined tray and refrigerate until the chocolate sets fully.</li>
    </ol>
