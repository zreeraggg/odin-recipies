    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian pasta dish that features wide, flat sheets of pasta layered with fillings such as a meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce, vegetables, and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The assembled dish is typically baked in an oven until hot and bubbly, with grated cheese on top. Lasagna can also refer specifically to the wide, flat noodle itself. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Spice and seasonings</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the onion. Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the meat with the onion until browned and fragrant. Break the meat up so it cooks evenly.</li>
        <li>Add canned tomatoes to the pan. Stir in salt, spices, and seasonings. Add a small pinch of sugar to balance the acidity. Let this sauce simmer gently for 15–20 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Stir in chopped fresh herbs near the end of cooking. Taste and adjust seasoning. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix cheese (ricotta or similar) with eggs and a pinch of salt. This creates the creamy binding layer.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to package instructions until just tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 °C (350 °F). Lightly grease a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake another 10–15 minutes until bubbly and lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This prevents structural collapse—lasagna respects patience.</li>
    </ol>
