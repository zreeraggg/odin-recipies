    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian pasta dish that features wide, flat sheets of pasta layered with fillings such as a meat sauce (ragù), béchamel sauce, vegetables, and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. The assembled dish is typically baked in an oven until hot and bubbly, with grated cheese on top. Lasagna can also refer specifically to the wide, flat noodle itself. </p>
